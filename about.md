This website is all about who I want to become. Here I write about things I do in my free time, stuff Iâ€™m learning at
the work and things I want to learn. This blog is about the path to become a better developer and here I hope share
with you all I've learned in this meantime.

*Thank You for reading!*

PS. If you want to know more about me, visit my [about.me page](https://about.me/vilar).
